This project is part of The Odin Project's full stack js track. Scope is to create and style a web page that looks like the google.com homepage, though this will not be a functional search.

Project overview: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

As part of this I should create an html doc and css stylesheet, and use a combination of custom code and elements replicated from google.com (using dev tools to inspect) to recreate the look and feel of that page.

Changes should be committed to git and pushed to github.
