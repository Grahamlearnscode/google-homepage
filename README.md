This project is part of The Odin Project's full stack js track. Scope is to create and style a web page that looks like the google.com homepage, though this will not be a functional search.

Project overview: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

As part of this I should create an html doc and css stylesheet, and use a combination of custom code and elements replicated from google.com (using dev tools to inspect) to recreate the look and feel of that page.

Changes should be committed to git and pushed to github.

Look and feel of the page is 95+% of the way there. There are slight differences in spacing, it's a few pixels off here and there. Google actually has a horizontal scroll when I'm viewing half-screen, it doesn't seem like it adds anything so I didn't replicate that. Google automatically focuses into search bar on page load which I didn't look into, and there's some issue with opacity inheritance on the apps block in the upper right that I didn't suss out.
But, it's very close, I'd ship it in this state and feel like I'll benefit more from keeping moving than from getting hung up on these minor issues.
